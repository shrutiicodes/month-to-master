			A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea,
			called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic
			unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one
			central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader
			argument.
